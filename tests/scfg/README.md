scfg Test Suite
===============

This directory contains tests for the scfg configuration format.

All tests in the ``invalid`` directory are expected to fail parsing, while
all tests in the ``valid`` directory are expected to parse successfully.

A parser which is being tested should read each file in the ``valid`` directory
and produce output identical to the corresponding file in the ``expected``
directory and reject all files in the ``invalid`` directory.

The following transformation rules should be applied for generating the expected
output from the valid input.


Transformation Rules
--------------------

The files in the ``expected`` directory are not identical to the input files in
the ``valid`` directory. The following transformations are applied:

* All comments are removed.
* Extraneous whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines) is removed
* All whitespace is normalized to a single space character.
* All names and parameters must be enclosed in double quotes.
* All unnecessary escapes are removed from names and parameters.
* All directives of a block must be indented by 4 spaces per level of nesting.

For example, the following input file:

    # This is a comment
    server   {
        listen  80   # Listen on port 80
        server_name    example.com   www.example.com

        location / {
            root   /var/www/html  # Document root
            index  index.html index.htm
        }
    }

Would produce the following expected output:

    "server" {
        "listen" "80"
        "server_name" "example.com" "www.example.com"
        "location" "/" {
            "root" "/var/www/html"
            "index" "index.html" "index.htm"
        }
    }
